# Welcome to Expressway!

This library provides additions to the RoadRunner actions and geometry libraries as well as an ActionRunner system for OpMode usage, and helpers for SDK conversions.

Note: Expressway is currently **alpha software** with multiple known issues.
While any testing and reporting of issues is appreciated, relying on it for your competition robot or code is not recommended. 

While in the 0.x.x versioning cycle, backwards compatibility will be on a best-effort basis and is **not guaranteed**.
